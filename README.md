# Roll Dice Game - Javascript training evaluation

As part of my studies, I programmed a dice game. 

## Rules of the game

Two players compete against each other, with the aim of being the first to reach 100 points. 
The first player rolls the die, and the result is automatically recorded. He can roll the dice again as many times as he likes and accumulate his score. When desired, the player can save his score. Then it's the next player's turn. 
If the dice lands on the number 1, the player's turn ends and his points for the turn drop to 0. It's now the next player's turn.
